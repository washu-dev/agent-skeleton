"""ZONE 2 — System prompt + result normalization.  ★ WRITE THIS ★

- SYSTEM_PROMPT: the instructions that define your agent's behavior and the exact
  output contract you want from the model.
- normalize_result(): turn the model's final text into the STABLE structured dict
  your agent returns.

Why a stable shape matters: the planner reads the structured DataPart artifact your
agent emits, so downstream callers depend on these keys always existing.
